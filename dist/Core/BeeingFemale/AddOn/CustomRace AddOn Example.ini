# This addon was written to demonstrate how to apply some BeeingFemale settings differently for specific races.
# If you want to change settings for specific actors only, refer to "AddOn CustomActor Settings Example.ini"
# in the "AddOn/CustomActorExample" folder.
# If you want to change some settings for all races, refer to "AddOn Global Settings Example.ini"
# in the "AddOn/GlobalSettingsExample" folder.
#
# If you want a specific race to give birth to a specific baby model (Actor),
# refer to "[3. Child-related settings]" below.
# If no baby model is specified via an addon, a copy of one parent's ActorBase
# is used for the baby model. (Which parent is chosen is determined by the
# "Baby Race Determination Chance" in the BeeingFemale MCM.)
# A backup copy of this file exists as "AddOn CustomRace Settings Example.ini"
# in the "BeeingFemale/AddOn/CustomRaceExample" folder.
#
# If a value is set in an addon ini with type=actor, that value is applied.

# Description of this addon shown in the BeeingFemale MCM
description=(Deactivated by default as it is just an example addon) This is an example ini to show how you can modify some BeeingFemale features for custom races

# Author of this addon shown in the BeeingFemale MCM

# Type must be one of "misc", "race", "cme", "actor", or "global".
# Other types are not recognized by BeeingFemale.
# Do NOT specify multiple types (e.g. "type=misc,race").
# If a value is set in an addon ini with type=actor, that value is applied to that actor.
# Even if a type=global addon exists, values set in type=race addons override it for the specified races.
# For custom race to work with ActorTypeNPC characters - race should have "child" in the name
type=race

# If you want this addon to only work when certain mods are installed, list those plugins.
# This example requires "TeraElinRace Remastered (https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/22930-teraelinrace-remastered/)".
# To list multiple mods, use "required=A.esp,B.esp,C.esp".
# Plugins must be comma-separated with no spaces.

# To have this addon disabled by default, set "enabled=false" (case-insensitive; "enabled=False" works).
# You can toggle this addon in the BeeingFemale MCM.
# This example addon is disabled by default to avoid conflicts with other addons.
enabled=false

# If you want this addon hidden from the BeeingFemale MCM, set "hidden=true"
# (case-insensitive; "hidden=True" works).
hidden=false

# If you want to prevent toggling this addon in the BeeingFemale MCM, set "locked=true"
# (case-insensitive; "locked=True" works).
locked=false

# To configure N races, set "races" to N.
# For example, to configure 10 races, change "races=2" below to "races=10".
# Due to Skyrim's MCM limits, the maximum N per ini is 80.
#
# To apply the same settings to N races, set "races=1" and list all race FormIDs
# in the "id" field (comma-separated, no spaces).
# To configure each race separately, set "races=N" and put each race FormID in the
# "id" field under "[RaceJ]" (1 <= j <= N).
# This example configures "TeraElinRace" and "TeraElinRaceVampire" separately, so "races=2".
races=2

#=========================================================
#=========================================================
# Settings for the first race must start with "[Race1]". The next race starts with "[Race2]", and so on.
# Any settings not defined inside "[RaceN]" (N is a positive integer) default to their base values.
[Race1]
# FormID (hex) for this race. Format: "PluginName:FormID" (without 0x).
# Example: in SSEEdit, "TeraElinRace" has FormID "XX001000" (XX is the load order index),
# so use "id=TeraElinRace:1000".
# You can list multiple races: "id=A:810,B:801,C:803".
# FormIDs must be comma-separated with no spaces.
# You may omit leading zeros in the FormID, e.g. "id=TeraElinRace:001000" or "id=TeraElinRace:00001000".

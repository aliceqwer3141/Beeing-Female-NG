# This addon was written to demonstrate how to apply some BeeingFemale settings differently for specific actors.
# If you want to change settings for specific races only, refer to
# "AddOn CustomRace Settings Example.ini" in the "AddOn/CustomRaceExample" folder.
# If you want to change some settings globally for all races, refer to
# "AddOn Global Settings Example.ini" in the "AddOn/GlobalSettingsExample" folder.
#
# If you want a specific actor to give birth to a specific baby model (Actor),
# refer to "[3. Actor child-related settings]" below.
# If no baby model is specified via an addon, a copy of one parent's ActorBase
# is used for the baby model. (Which parent is chosen is determined by the
# "Baby Race Determination Chance" in the BeeingFemale MCM.)
# A backup copy of this file exists as "AddOn CustomActor Settings Example.ini"
# in the "BeeingFemale/AddOn/CustomActorExample" folder.

description=(Deactivated by default as it is just an example addon) This is an example ini to show how you can modify some BeeingFemale features for some actors

# Author of this addon shown in the BeeingFemale MCM

# Type must be one of "misc", "race", "cme", "actor", or "global".
# Other types are not recognized by BeeingFemale.
# Do NOT specify multiple types (e.g. "type=misc,race").
# Even if type=race or type=global addons exist, values in type=actor addons override
# them for the specified actors.
type=actor

# If you want this addon to only work when certain mods are installed, list those plugins.
# This example only requires Skyrim.esm and Dragonborn.esm.
# To list multiple mods, use "required=A.esp,B.esp,C.esp".
# Plugins must be comma-separated with no spaces.
required=Skyrim.esm,Dragonborn.esm

# To have this addon disabled by default, set "enabled=false" (case-insensitive; "enabled=False" works).
# You can toggle this addon in the BeeingFemale MCM.
# This example addon is disabled by default to avoid conflicts with other addons.
enabled=false

# If you want this addon hidden from the BeeingFemale MCM, set "hidden=true"
# (case-insensitive; "hidden=True" works).
hidden=false

# If you want to prevent toggling this addon in the BeeingFemale MCM, set "locked=true"
# (case-insensitive; "locked=True" works).
locked=false

# To configure N actors, set "actors" to N.
# For example, to configure 10 actors, change "actors=2" below to "actors=10".
# Due to Skyrim's MCM limits, the maximum N per ini is 80.
#
# To apply the same settings to N actors, set "actors=1" and list all actor RefIDs
# in the "id" field (comma-separated, no spaces).
# To configure each actor separately, set "actors=N" and put each actor RefID in the
# "id" field under "[ActorJ]" (1 <= j <= N).
# This example configures "Nazeem (Ref ID: 1A6A4)" and "Mirakk (Ref ID: YY01FB99, YY is the
# index for "Dragonborn.esm")" separately, so "actors=2".
actors=2

#=========================================================
#=========================================================
# Settings for the first actor must start with "[Actor1]". The next actor starts with "[Actor2]", and so on.
# Any settings not defined inside "[ActorN]" (N is a positive integer) default to their base values.
[Actor1]
# FormID (hex) for this actor. Format: "PluginName:FormID" (without 0x).
# Example: in SSEEdit, "NazeemREF" has FormID "XX01A6A4" (XX is the load order index for
# "Skyrim.esm"), so use "id=Skyrim:1A6A4".
# You can list multiple actors: "id=A:810,B:801,C:803".
# FormIDs must be comma-separated with no spaces.
# You may omit leading zeros: "id=Skyrim:01A6A4" or "id=Skyrim:0001A6A4".

# (Armor).
#
# To define item-type baby models, use "BabyArmor_Female=" and "BabyArmor_Male=".

#
# To define actor-type baby models, use "BabyActor_Female=", "BabyActor_Male=",
# "BabyActor_FemalePlayer=", and "BabyActor_MalePlayer=".
# This is equivalent to using those instead of "BabyArmor_Female=" and "BabyArmor_Male="
# in "Default Baby Items.ini".

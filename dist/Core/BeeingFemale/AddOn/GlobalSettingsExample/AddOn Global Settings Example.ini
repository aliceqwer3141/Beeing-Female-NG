# This addon was written to demonstrate how to apply some BeeingFemale settings equally to all races.
# If you only want to change settings for a specific actor, refer to
# "AddOn CustomActor Settings Example.ini" in the "AddOn/CustomActorExample" folder.
# If you only want to change settings for a specific race, refer to
# "AddOn CustomRace Settings Example.ini" in the "AddOn/CustomRaceExample" folder.
#
# If you want all races to give birth to a specific baby model (Actor),
# refer to "[3. Baby-related Settings]" below.
# If no baby model is specified through an addon, a model copied from one of the parents’
# ActorBase will be used as the baby model.
# (Which parent’s ActorBase is used is determined by the “Baby Race Determination Chance”
# setting in the BeeingFemale MCM.)
#
# If a value is set in a type=actor addon ini file, that value will be applied.
# If there is no value in a type=actor addon ini file, but there is a value in a type=race
# addon ini file, then that value will be applied.
# A type=global addon ini must exist only once in the "BeeingFemale/AddOn" folder.
# Otherwise, the settings will conflict with each other!
# A backup copy of this file exists in the "BeeingFemale/AddOn/GlobalSettingsExample"
# folder under the name "AddOn Global Settings Example.ini".

# The type must be one of: "misc", "race", "cme", "actor", or "global".
# Other types will not be recognized by BeeingFemale.
# Also, never specify multiple types (e.g. "type=misc,race"), as BeeingFemale will not recognize it.
# If a value is set in a type=actor addon ini file, that value will be applied to that actor.
# If not, and a value is set in a type=race addon ini file, that value will be applied.

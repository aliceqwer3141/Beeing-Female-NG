# This addon was written to introduce how to apply some of the items in BeeingFemale equally to all races.
# If you only want to change settings for a specific actor, please refer to "AddOn CustomActor Settings Example.ini" in the __PH0__ folder.
# If you only want to change settings for a specific race, please refer to "AddOn CustomRace Settings Example.ini" in the __PH0__ folder.
#
# If you want all races to have a specific child model (Actor), see "[3. Child related items]" below.
# If you do not specify a child model through the add-on, a model copied from the Actorbase of one of the parents is used as the child model. (BeeingFemale Depending on the “baby race determination probability” in MCM, whether to use the father’s Actorbase or the mother’s Actorbase is determined.)
# 
# If there is a value set in the addon ini file where type=actor, that setting value is applied.
# If there is no value set in the addon ini file with type=actor, and there is a value set in the addon ini file with type=race, the corresponding setting value is applied.
# There must be only one add-on ini named "type=global" in the __PH1__ folder. Otherwise, your settings will conflict with each other!
# A backup copy of this file is located in the __PH1__ folder with the name "AddOn Global Settings Example.ini".

# If you want your baby to be born only with a specific child model, regardless of race, change it to "Global_Female_Force_This_Baby=true" (case insensitive, i.e. you can write "Global_Female_Force_This_Baby=True").
# If you set this item to true, you must define an actor-type child model (NPC) or an item-type child model (Armor).
#
# To define an itemized child model, you must use "BabyArmor_Female=" and "BabyArmor_Male=". Please refer to "Default Baby Items.ini" located in the same folder as this add-on file.
#
# To define an actor-like child model, you must use __PH0__, __PH1__, __PH2__, and "Global_BabyActor_MalePlayer=".
# Basically, this is equivalent to using __PH3__, __PH4__, __PH5__, and "Global_BabyActor_MalePlayer=" instead of "BabyArmor_Female=" and __PH2__ in "Default Baby Items.ini".
# If you don't know what I mean, see the explanation below...
# The default is false. In other words, if a child model already exists, the specified child model is added.
# If true, replaces the existing child model with the specified child model.

(Not case sensitive. In other words, you can write "Global_MixWithCopyActorBase=True").
# If it is "Global_MixWithCopyActorBase=false" and the baby actor models are specified above, the baby models specified above will be born!

# (Applies only when BeeingFemale MCM sets "Birth Type" to "Baby" and Global_MixWithCopyActorBase=true!)
# If you specify the baby actor models above, this is the probability that the baby models specified above will be born at birth.

# If a child model compatible with BeeingFemale is specified as __PH0__, __PH1__, __PH2__, and "BabyActor_MalePlayer=", and the property of that child model's __PH4__ script is explicitly specified in the plugin, then the child's height at birth is determined to be __PH5__ (one of property in the __PH6__ script).
# In all other cases, this item is used when you want to change the height scale determined by this actor immediately after the child is born.
# 
# This value must of course be an integer greater than 0. Otherwise, BeeingFemale will automatically change it to the default value of 0.7.
# If you want to change this value, we recommend setting it to 0.7 or higher. If your child is smaller than 0.7, your child may become invisible in-game!

# This item is used when you want to change the height scale of your child when they are fully grown. This applies regardless of whether or not a compatible child model is specified for BeeingFemale.
# "Global_finalScale=1.0" means that the height of a fully grown child will be the same as (the height of an adult NPC belonging to the child's race) regardless of race. (For example, if the child's race is a giant, the height of a fully grown child will be the same as the height of the giant NPC.)

# This item is used when you want to change the time it takes for a child to fully grow.
# If a child model compatible with BeeingFemale is specified as __PH0__, __PH1__, __PH2__, and "BabyActor_MalePlayer=", and the property in that child model's __PH4__ script is explicitly specified in the plugin, then that child will become fully grown after __PH5__ (one of the property in the __PH6__ script) number of days.
# All other children will become fully grown after a number of days of "growth time" (can be set in BeeingFemale MCM).
# Unless you use a mod that adds a child model compatible with BeeingFemale to a specific race, such as __PH0__ or "BFASE_RSChildren_SE_Opt", a model that copies the Actorbase of one of the parents is used as the child's model. (BeeingFemale MCM's "Baby Race Determination Probability" determines whether to use the father's Actorbase or the mother's Actorbase.)
#
# If the selected parent race has a child model compatible with BeeingFemale (with the __PH0__ script added), and is "Global_MatureTimeScale=0.5", the child will become fully grown in __PH2__ number of days (in-game time).
# In all other cases, if "Global_MatureTimeScale=0.5", the child will become fully grown in "(time required for growth) * 0.5" number of days (in-game time).
#
# This value must be greater than 0. Otherwise, BeeingFemale will automatically change it to the default value of 1.0.
# To prevent CTDs caused by setscale() functions being called too frequently, the minimum time it takes for a child to fully grow will be set to "Global_MatureStep" in-game time.
# The default is 1.0.
